### GitHub Project Management

#### **Project Board Structure**
1. **Backlog**: All future features and improvements
2. **Sprint Ready**: Items prepared for current milestone
3. **In Progress**: Active development work
4. **Review**: Completed work awaiting approval
5. **Done**: Completed and validated features

#### **Issue Lifecycle**
1. **Creation**: Use issue templates for consistency
2. **Triage**: Assign priority, milestone, and labels
3. **Assignment**: Allocate to team member with expertise
4. **Development**: Regular progress updates in comments
5. **Review**: Code review and testing validation
6. **Closure**: Verification against acceptance criteria

### Quality Assurance Process

#### **Code Quality Gates**
- All code must pass `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
- Unit tests required for new functionality
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance benchmarks maintained

#### **Content Quality Standards**
- All narrative content follows established lore
- Dialogue trees tested for all branches
- Magic system content validated against Balance Framework
- Faction interactions tested for political consistency

### Risk Management Protocols

#### **Early Warning Indicators**
- Build time exceeding 30 seconds (complexity concern)
- Test coverage dropping below 70% (quality risk)
- Performance regression >10% (optimization needed)
- Milestone delivery confidence <80% (scope adjustment needed)

#### **Escalation Process**
1. **Developer Level**: Daily standup discussion
2. **Team Level**: Weekly planning meeting
3. **Project Level**: Milestone review and scope adjustment
4. **Stakeholder Level**: Major timeline or scope changes

## Content Development Workflow

### Content Creation Pipeline

#### **1. Lore Development**
- Reference Game Design Document for consistency
- Create detailed background for new content
- Validate against existing world building
- Document magical/political implications

#### **2. System Integration**
- Identify required game system interactions
- Plan magic system integration points
- Design faction reputation effects
- Create character progression hooks

#### **3. Implementation**
- Create database entries following schema
- Implement dialogue trees with proper branching
- Add location descriptions with magical details
- Test all interactive elements

#### **4. Validation**
- Playtest for narrative consistency
- Verify faction relationship effects
- Test magical interaction descriptions
- Confirm choice consequence implementation

### Content Categories & Owners

#### **Core Narrative** (Main storyline and world building)
- Location descriptions and atmospheric content
- Major NPC characterization and dialogue
- Faction storylines and political events
- Overarching mystery and revelation content

#### **Magic System Content** (Scientific magic implementation)
- Spell descriptions with scientific explanations
- Crystal formation lore and properties
- Theory learning materials and explanations
- Magical phenomenon descriptions

#### **Social Systems** (NPCs and faction interactions)
- Dialogue trees with faction-aware responses
- Reputation consequence descriptions
- Political event narratives
- Cross-faction relationship scenarios

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing Approach

#### **Unit Testing** (Target: >80% coverage)
- Magic calculation engine (currently comprehensive)
- Faction reputation system calculations
- Character progression mathematics
- Save/load serialization verification

#### **Integration Testing**
- Magic system interaction with player state
- Faction effects on dialogue availability
- Character progression affecting success rates
- World state persistence across sessions

#### **System Testing**
- Complete gameplay sessions (2-3 hours)
- Faction questline completion scenarios
- Resource management under various play styles
- Performance testing with full content load

### Manual Testing Protocols

#### **Playtesting Sessions**
- Weekly internal playtesting with development team
- Monthly external playtesting with target audience
- Specific scenario testing for new features
- User experience testing for interface improvements

#### **Content Validation**
- Narrative consistency checking across all content
- Faction relationship verification in dialogue
- Magic system description accuracy
- Balance validation through extended play sessions

## Documentation Maintenance

### Living Documentation Strategy

#### **Code Documentation**
- Inline documentation for all public APIs
- Module-level documentation explaining system interactions
- Example usage for complex systems
- Performance characteristics and limitations

#### **Design Documentation**
- Game Design Document as authoritative source
- Balance Framework for all numerical values
- Architecture documentation for code organization
- Content guidelines for narrative consistency

#### **Player Documentation**
- Help system integrated into game interface
- Command reference with examples
- Magic system guide with scientific explanations
- Faction guide with political relationship explanations

### Documentation Review Cycle

#### **Weekly Reviews**
- Update project status in roadmap documentation
- Review and update milestone progress tracking
- Validate documentation against current implementation
- Identify documentation gaps for new features

#### **Monthly Reviews**
- Comprehensive documentation audit
- Player feedback integration into guides
- Design document updates for scope changes
- Archive or update obsolete documentation

## Communication Protocols
