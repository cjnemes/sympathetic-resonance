- Create knowledge-gated content
- Estimated time: 1 week

## 🛠️ Technical Context

### **Architecture Overview**
```
src/
├── core/           # Player, WorldState, GameEngine
├── systems/        # Magic, Factions, Dialogue, Knowledge
├── input/          # Command parsing and handling
├── persistence/    # Database and save/load
└── ui/             # User interface components
```

### **Key Files to Know**
- `src/systems/magic/calculation_engine.rs` - Scientific magic formulas
- `src/input/command_handlers.rs` - All command execution logic
- `src/core/game_engine.rs` - Main game loop and coordination
- `src/persistence/database.rs` - Database schema and operations
- `docs/roadmap-issue-tracker.md` - Comprehensive project tracking

### **Build Status**
- ✅ `cargo build` - Successful with minor warnings
- ✅ `cargo run` - Game starts and runs properly
- ✅ `cargo run -- --init-db` - Database initialization works
- ⚠️ `cargo test` - Some tests failing (11 failures, mostly database-related)

## 📊 Testing Status

### **Working Tests** (58 passing)
- Magic calculation engine (comprehensive coverage)
- Player state management
- Core data structures
- Save/load functionality
- Basic command parsing

### **Failing Tests** (11 failures)
- Database foreign key constraints in tests
- Some command parser expectations changed
- Natural language processing edge cases
- These are **non-critical** and don't affect core gameplay

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### **Why Complete Milestone 2 First**
1. **Solid Foundation**: Ensures rock-solid technical base before content expansion
2. **Quality Gates**: Meets MVP requirements (>80% test coverage)
3. **Risk Reduction**: Addresses technical debt before it compounds
4. **Team Velocity**: Clean codebase enables faster content development
5. **Performance**: Validates all systems work seamlessly together

### **Next Major Milestone (Milestone 3)**
**GitHub Issue #2**: [Content Database Population](https://github.com/cjnemes/sympathetic-resonance/issues/2)
- 8 rich locations with magical properties
- 12 major NPCs with faction-aware dialogue
- 3 complete faction questlines
- Educational content integration

## 🔧 Development Environment

### **Required Tools**
- Rust 1.70+ (stable)
- SQLite 3.x
- Git with GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Optional: cargo-tarpaulin for coverage

### **Key Commands**
```bash
cargo build          # Build project
cargo run            # Run game
cargo test           # Run tests
cargo run -- --init-db  # Initialize database
gh issue list        # View GitHub issues
```

## 🎮 Game Design Context

### **Core Vision**
Science-based magic text adventure where players learn through experimentation, manage finite resources, and navigate complex faction politics in a richly detailed low fantasy world.

### **Unique Features**
- **Scientific Magic**: Real physics principles in spell calculations
- **Faction Politics**: Complex reputation system with cross-faction effects
- **Educational Gameplay**: Learning through experimentation and discovery
- **Resource Management**: Mental energy, crystal degradation, finite resources

### **Balance Framework**
All numerical values documented in `BALANCE_FRAMEWORK.md` with scientific justification.

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **What NOT to Change**
- Magic calculation formulas (extensively balanced and tested)
- Core game architecture (well-designed and functional)
- Database schema (working properly after foreign key fix)
- Faction system design (complex but working correctly)

### **Focus Areas**
- Test coverage expansion for quality gates
- Content creation for richer gameplay
- Performance optimization and polish
- Educational content integration

### **Quality Standards**
- >80% test coverage required for MVP
- <100ms response time for all commands
- Scientific accuracy in all magic explanations
