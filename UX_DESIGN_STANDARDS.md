## Design Principles

### Core UX Tenets
1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Clear, predictable interactions beat witty but confusing responses
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity gradually as players advance
3. **Consistent Feedback**: Similar actions always produce similar response patterns
4. **Forgiveness**: Players should never be permanently blocked by input mistakes
5. **Discoverability**: Important features should be findable through exploration

### Tone & Voice Guidelines
- **Neutral Narrator**: Third-person perspective with scientific objectivity
- **Immersive Description**: Rich environmental details without overwhelming text walls
- **Respectful Feedback**: Error messages that educate rather than scold
- **Dynamic Responses**: Descriptions that reflect character knowledge and faction relationships

## Command Interface Standards

### Command Categories & Syntax

**Movement Commands:**
```
Standard: north, south, east, west, up, down
Shortcuts: n, s, e, w, u, d
Natural: go north, move to the library, enter the building
Exit Listing: Always show available exits in location descriptions
```

**Examination Commands:**
```
Basic: look, examine <target>, inspect <target>
Shortcuts: l, ex <target>, x <target>
Magical: analyze <target>, resonate with <target>
Contextual: study <theory>, investigate <mystery>
```

**Magic Commands:**
```
Casting: cast <spell> using <crystal> on <target>
Shortcuts: cast <spell> <target>, use <crystal> for <spell>
Analysis: check crystal integrity, examine magical signature
Theory: study <theory>, research <topic>, experiment with <combination>
```

**Social Commands:**
```
Basic: talk to <person>, ask <person> about <topic>
Advanced: persuade <person> to <action>, intimidate <person>
Faction: check faction standing, review reputation
```

**Inventory & Status:**
```
Inventory: inventory, inv, i, items
Status: status, stats, condition, energy
Equipment: crystals, check crystals, crystal status
```

### Command Parsing Rules

**Synonym Recognition:**
- Multiple valid ways to express the same action
- Common abbreviations and shortcuts supported
- Contextual understanding (e.g., "it" refers to last examined object)

**Partial Matching:**
- Accept unique partial commands ("ex" for "examine")
- Disambiguate with suggestions when multiple matches exist
- Case-insensitive input processing

**Natural Language Support:**
```
Supported: "cast healing using quartz crystal on the wounded guard"
Simplified: "heal guard with quartz"
Contextual: "heal guard" (uses last-equipped crystal)
```

## Feedback & Response Patterns

### Success Response Templates

**Standard Action Success:**
```
Pattern: [Action Result] + [Environmental Change] + [Status Update]
Example: "You successfully heal the guard's wounds using sympathetic resonance.
The amethyst crystal dims slightly as its structure degrades. Your mental energy
drops to 45/80, and you feel moderate fatigue building."
```

**Discovery Responses:**
```
Pattern: [Observation] + [Knowledge Integration] + [New Options]
Example: "The crystalline formation resonates at frequency 7, matching your amethyst.
Your study of Neural Amplification theory suggests this could enhance healing magic.
You can now 'experiment with frequency matching' or 'study the formation's structure'."
```

### Contextual Information Display

**Location Descriptions:**
```
Structure:
1. Basic visual description
2. Magical signatures (if detectable)
3. Notable NPCs and objects
4. Available exits
5. Environmental atmosphere

Example:
"The Industrial Consortium laboratory buzzes with controlled magical energy.
Crystalline matrices line the walls, their resonance frequencies creating a
subtle harmonic pattern. Dr. Elena Thorne works at a central station, surrounded
by precision-cut crystals. A heavily reinforced vault door leads north, while
the main corridor extends south.

The air thrums with organized magical research."
```

**Character Status Display:**
```
Mental Energy: 65/80 (Moderate fatigue affecting efficiency)
Active Crystal: Amethyst (78% integrity, High purity)
Knowledge: 4 theories mastered, 2 in progress
Faction Standing: Council +35, Underground -15, Scholars +20

Current Research: Neural Amplification theory (67% complete)
```

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Error Categories & Responses

**Command Not Recognized:**
```
Pattern: [Acknowledge attempt] + [Suggest alternatives] + [Context help]
Example: "I don't understand 'flibber the crystal'. Did you mean:
- 'examine the crystal' to study its properties
- 'use the crystal' to cast magic
- 'check crystal integrity' to assess condition
Type 'help magic' for magical command guidance."
```

**Invalid Target:**
```
Pattern: [Clarify target] + [List valid options] + [Suggest examination]
Example: "There's no 'golden orb' here. You can see:
- amethyst crystal formation
- ancient stone pedestal
- crystalline research notes
Try 'look around' to see everything available."
```

**Insufficient Resources:**
```
Pattern: [Explain limitation] + [Show current status] + [Suggest solutions]
Example: "You're too mentally fatigued to attempt complex magic (Energy: 15/80,
Fatigue: 85/100). You could:
- 'rest' to recover some energy (-10 fatigue per hour)
- 'meditate' for faster recovery (-15 fatigue per hour)
- 'sleep' for full recovery (but time will pass)"
```

**Failed Magic Attempts:**
```
Pattern: [Describe failure] + [Explain cause] + [Learning opportunity]
Example: "The resonance fails to stabilize, and the healing energy dissipates
harmlessly. Your crystal's frequency (6) doesn't match well with the target's
life energy patterns. You gain 2 XP in Sympathetic Binding theory from this
failed attempt."
```

### Progressive Help System

**Contextual Hints:**
- First-time location visits include subtle gameplay hints

### Interactive Examples

**Command Tutorials:**
```
Example: help casting

> Command: cast [spell] using [crystal] on [target]

Try it now with: cast light using quartz
[System executes command with tutorial feedback]

Your quartz crystal (integrity: 95%) resonates at frequency 4, perfect for
light generation. Mental energy: 75→70. The crystal creates a soft, steady
glow illuminating the chamber.

Related commands: examine crystal, check energy, study light theory
```
