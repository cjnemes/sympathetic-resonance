## System Enhancement Request

### **Target System**
- [ ] Magic System (calculation engine, resonance, crystals)
- [ ] Faction System (reputation, politics, relationships)
- [ ] Character Progression (attributes, theories, experience)
- [ ] Dialogue System (NPCs, conversation trees)
- [ ] World State (locations, persistence, events)
- [ ] Combat System (magical combat, conflict resolution)

### **Enhancement Description**
**What system behavior needs improvement?**
<!-- Describe the current system behavior that needs enhancement -->

**What specific improvement are you proposing?**
<!-- Describe the desired enhancement in detail -->

### **Alignment with Project Goals**
**How does this enhancement support the core vision?**
- [ ] Enhances science-based magic authenticity
- [ ] Improves meaningful choice consequences
- [ ] Strengthens resource management gameplay
- [ ] Enriches faction political complexity
- [ ] Supports educational gameplay through experimentation

### **Technical Considerations**

**Affected Modules:**
- [ ] `src/core/` (Player, WorldState, GameEngine)
- [ ] `src/systems/magic/` (Calculation engine, resonance)
- [ ] `src/systems/factions/` (Reputation, politics)
- [ ] `src/systems/dialogue/` (NPCs, conversation)
- [ ] `src/persistence/` (Save/load, database)
- [ ] `src/input/` (Command parsing)

**Balance Framework Impact:**
- [ ] Requires new mathematical formulas
- [ ] Modifies existing balance calculations
- [ ] Creates new resource management mechanics
- [ ] No balance implications

**Performance Considerations:**
- [ ] May affect magic calculation performance
- [ ] Could impact save/load times
- [ ] Might increase memory usage
- [ ] No expected performance impact

### **Implementation Approach**

**Proposed Technical Solution:**
<!-- Describe how this enhancement would be implemented -->

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
<!-- List any alternative implementations you've considered -->

**Breaking Changes:**
- [ ] Requires save file migration
- [ ] Changes public API interfaces
- [ ] Modifies existing game behavior
- [ ] No breaking changes expected

### **Testing Requirements**

**Unit Testing Needs:**
- [ ] New mathematical formula validation
- [ ] Edge case behavior verification
- [ ] Performance benchmark establishment

**Integration Testing:**
- [ ] System interaction verification
- [ ] Cross-faction effect validation
- [ ] Player progression impact testing

**Playtesting Focus:**
- [ ] Balance validation through extended play
- [ ] Player experience impact assessment
- [ ] Tutorial/help system updates needed

### **Content Impact**

**Narrative Considerations:**
- [ ] Requires new dialogue content
- [ ] Affects existing faction storylines
- [ ] Needs location description updates
- [ ] Impacts magical theory explanations

**Educational Content:**
- [ ] New scientific explanations needed
- [ ] Help system updates required
- [ ] Tutorial modifications necessary

### **Success Criteria**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
<!-- List specific, measurable criteria for completion -->
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] New functionality has >80% test coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained or improved
- [ ] Documentation updated for user-facing changes

### **Milestone Association**
**Target Milestone:**
- [ ] Milestone 2: Core Systems (Current)
- [ ] Milestone 3: Content & Polish
- [ ] Post-MVP Enhancement
- [ ] Future Version

**Priority Level:**
- [ ] Critical (Blocking milestone delivery)
- [ ] High (Important for milestone quality)
- [ ] Medium (Enhances player experience)
- [ ] Low (Nice-to-have improvement)

### **Additional Context**
<!-- Any additional information, screenshots, or examples that help explain the enhancement -->
