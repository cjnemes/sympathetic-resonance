## Technical Risks

### 游댮 CRITICAL: System Complexity Overload

**Risk:** The interconnected magic, faction, and progression systems become too complex to implement reliably or debug effectively.

**Impact:**
- Development paralysis from overwhelming complexity
- Bug cascade where fixes in one system break others
- Performance degradation from over-engineered solutions
- Developer burnout from cognitive overload

**Probability:** HIGH (60%) - Complex systems naturally tend toward this

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Modular Development with Interface Contracts**
   - Implement each system (magic, factions, knowledge) as separate modules
   - Define clear APIs between systems before implementation
   - Use dependency injection to isolate systems during testing

2. **Progressive Integration Testing**
   - Build integration test suite before connecting systems
   - Weekly integration checkpoints to catch cascade failures early
   - Automated regression testing for all system interactions

3. **Complexity Budget Management**
   - Set hard limits on system interaction depth (max 3 layers)
   - Regular code review sessions focused on simplification
   - "Complexity debt" tracking with mandatory reduction sprints

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Build times exceed 30 seconds
- Test suite takes >5 minutes to run
