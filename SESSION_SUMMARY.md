## 🎓 Best Practices Established

### Development Workflow
1. ✅ Create issues before implementing features
2. ✅ Use feature branches with descriptive names
3. ✅ Write comprehensive commit messages
4. ✅ Update documentation alongside code
5. ✅ Ensure all tests pass before PR
6. ✅ Use appropriate labels and milestones

### Code Standards
1. ✅ Zero tolerance for compilation warnings
2. ✅ Zero tolerance for clippy warnings
3. ✅ 100% test pass rate required
4. ✅ Security-first approach
5. ✅ Documentation currency with code

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Combat System
**Decision:** ❌ Out of Scope for MVP
**Rationale:** Educational focus over combat mechanics
**Future:** Can be added post-MVP if needed

### EventBus System
**Decision:** ✅ Remove (preserved in .bak)
**Rationale:** Currently unused, adds complexity
**Future:** Can be restored if event-driven architecture needed

### Save/Load Priority
**Decision:** ✅ Implement immediately
**Rationale:** Core functionality users expect
**Result:** Fully functional in PR #19

### Quest Content Priority
**Decision:** ✅ High priority for v0.5.0
**Rationale:** Maximum player value, leverages complete systems
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks Phase 1
